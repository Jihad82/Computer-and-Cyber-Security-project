# Encryption and Decryption Website

This is a simple web application that allows you to encrypt and decrypt text using a cipher algorithm. The application provides a user-friendly interface where you can enter a message, choose an encryption key, and perform the encryption or decryption process.

## Features

- **Encryption**: Enter the text you want to encrypt and choose a secret key. The application will encrypt the text using the cipher algorithm.
- **Decryption**: Enter the encrypted text and provide the correct key to decrypt the message and reveal the original text.
- **Cipher Algorithm**: The application uses a specific cipher algorithm to perform the encryption and decryption operations. The details of the algorithm can be found in the source code.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the source code files.
2. Open the index.html file in a web browser.
3. You will see a text input field for entering the message and another input field for the encryption key.
4. To encrypt a message, enter the text in the "Message" input field and choose a key in the "Encryption Key" input field. Click the "Encrypt" button to perform the encryption.
5. To decrypt a message, enter the encrypted text in the "Encrypted Text" input field and provide the correct key in the "Decryption Key" input field. Click the "Decrypt" button to perform the decryption.
6. The result will be displayed in the output section of the webpage.

Note: Make sure to keep the encryption key secure and share it only with the intended recipients. Losing the key may result in the permanent loss of the original message.

## Development

If you want to modify or enhance the application, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the source code files.
2. Open the files in a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE).
3. The main logic for encryption and decryption can be found in the script.js file.
4. Modify the code as per your requirements. You can change the cipher algorithm or add additional features to the application.
5. Save the changes and test the application in a web browser.
